# PHEME SIR Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for analyzing the [PHEME dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078) and creating Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-like graphs to visualize the spread of rumors and non-rumors in the dataset.

## Scripts

The repository includes the following scripts:

1. `event_stats.py` - Provides statistics for the events in the PHEME dataset, such as the number of rumors and non-rumors.

2. `event_sir_data.py` - Accepts an event as input and generates a CSV file with SIR data (timestamps, susceptible, infected, and recovered user counts) for that event.

3. `visualize_sir_data.py` - Accepts an event as input, reads the corresponding SIR data from the CSV file generated by `event_sir_data.py`, and creates a beautiful SIR-like graph using Altair.

## Usage

1. **Event statistics:**
   Run `event_stats.py` to get statistics for each event in the PHEME dataset.

   ```
   python event_stats.py
   ```

   The script will output the number of rumors and non-rumors for each event, sorted by the total number of rumors and non-rumors in descending order.

2. **Generate SIR data:**
   Run `event_sir_data.py` with the event name as a command-line argument to generate SIR data for the specified event.

   ```
   python event_sir_data.py <event_name>
   ```

   Replace `<event_name>` with the name of the event for which you want to generate the SIR data. The script will create a CSV file named `<event_name>_sir_data.csv` containing the SIR data for the specified event.

3. **Visualize SIR data:**
   Run `visualize_sir_data.py` with the event name as a command-line argument to visualize the SIR data for the specified event.

   ```
   python visualize_sir_data.py <event_name>
   ```

   Replace `<event_name>` with the name of the event for which you want to visualize the SIR data. The script will read the SIR data from the `<event_name>_sir_data.csv` file and display a beautiful SIR-like graph using Altair.
